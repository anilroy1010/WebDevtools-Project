                <li><button class="collapsible">How to choose the right website plan</button>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Choosing the right website plan is crucial for the success of your online presence.
                            When selecting a website plan, consider your site's purpose and anticipated traffic. Make sure the plan includes enough storage and bandwidth for your content and visitors. Security features like SSL certificates and regular backups are essential to keep your site safe. It's also important to choose a plan with strong customer support to help with any issues that may arise. As your site grows, ensure the plan allows for easy upgrades in resources and features.

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            Website hosting is where your website's files are stored, and it determines how quickly and reliably your site loads. A reliable hosting provider ensures your site stays online and loads fast for visitors. Your domain name is your website's address (e.g., www.yoursite.com), and it's important to choose one that's memorable, relevant to your business, and easy to type. When you register a domain, ensure it's properly linked to your hosting provider so visitors can access your site.

                        <p>
                            SEO (Search Engine Optimization) helps your website rank higher on search engines like Google, making it easier for people to find you. Start by researching keywords related to your business and incorporating them into your content. Make sure your website's structure is easy for both users and search engines to navigate, including optimizing page titles, headings, and descriptions. Regularly update your site with valuable, high-quality content, and ensure it's mobile-friendly. Finally, track your site's performance with tools like Google Analytics to improve your SEO over time.

                        <p>
                            If your website is down, check your hosting service or DNS settings. Slow loading times can often be fixed by optimizing images, enabling caching, and minimizing the number of elements on your pages. Broken links or missing pages should be identified and corrected promptly to avoid negative impacts on user experience and SEO. For formatting issues, test your site on different browsers and devices to ensure it's responsive. Lastly, maintain website security by keeping software updated and using SSL certificates, and make regular backups to prevent data loss.

                            Your website's security is critical for protecting both your business and your visitors. We recommend using an SSL certificate, which makes your site more secure and trustworthy to users. Regular updates and protection tools will keep your site safe from potential threats. We'll also make sure that you have the right security measures in place to protect your data and your customers' information.
